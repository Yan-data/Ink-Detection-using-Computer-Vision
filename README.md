# Ink-Detection-using-Computer-Vision (Kaggle Competition)

## About

It's a tensorflow solution for the Kaggle competition the Ink Detection Progress Prize ($100,000 in prizes), which is about the sub-problem of detecting ink from 3d x-ray scans of fragments of papyrus which became detached from some of the excavated scrolls. This subcontest is run on Kaggle since it's a more traditional data science / machine learning problem of building a model that can be verified against known ground truth data.

## Data
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection/data

## Programs
Data Understanding file helps to understand and visualize the data.
Make tiles file extract selected scans for further analysis.
Ink detection file loads data, reads images, trains, validates and fine tunes the model.

## Description:
Designed, trained, and evaluated a 3D image segmentation model detecting ink patterns in 3D X-ray scans of papyrus fragments
## Technologies Used: 
Tensorflow, OpenCV, Numpy, Matplotlib, glob
## Outcome:
Achieved a reasonable metric despite limited resources, demonstrating successful ink pattern detection in 3D X-ray scans of papyrus fragments using computer vision
